# Next steps

-  truncating the distribution of *s* at -0.01 and 0.0005. I was just wondering if we could check that this is, in fact, the case â€” may I ask you to rerun the simulations for *alpha* = -5 and *beta* = 1000 with the truncated distribution?

# To do

- PR for rand_distr for a SkewNormal
- Implement in R64
- How do I even get a NaN??
- Test correctness of SkewNormal simulation
- Add StandardNormal as a struct?
- Convert Parameters to an Array1 in the UnitSphere
